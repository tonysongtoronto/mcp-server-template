## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Statistical functions (sum, mean, median, mode, min, max)
- Rounding functions (floor, ceiling, round)
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses; degrees/radians conversions)

## Installation
Just clone this repository and save it locally somewhere on your computer.

Then add this server to your MCP configuration file:

```json
"math": {
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["PATH\\TO\\PROJECT\\math-mcp\\build\\index.js"]
}
```

Replace `PATH\\TO\\PROJECT` with the actual path to where you cloned the repository.
